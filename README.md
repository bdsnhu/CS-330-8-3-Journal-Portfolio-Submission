How do I approach designing software?
I would have to understand and define the user needs and requirements, I would have to plan and architect to break down components, choose tech, and design data/flows, I would design UX/UI, and finally I would build and test the code, iterate, and validate.
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The new design skills that I now know from my project that I can utilize is I learned how to create different shape meshes, I learned how to render a texture image around a object, I learned how to create lighting for a scene, 
and I learned how to incorporate different controls for the camera and the mouse.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
The design process that I followed for my project work, is that I first created the soil mesh, then I created the rectangle hedge bush mesh, then I created the pyramid bush mesh, then I created the bricks mesh,
then, I created three more rectangle meshes, then I created three cone bush meshes, then I rendered all of the objects with different images to make it look like a picture, and finally I created three different light sources to brighten the scene.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I can use tactics from my design approach to be applied in future work like develeping a scene in a game, or creating screen savers for computers.
How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs by reading the directions first, then research about it, then designing the scenes, and finally testing the code.
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
The new development strategies that I used while working on my 3d scene are: creating shape meshes, rendering images around the objects, and creating light sources to see the scene better.
How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration factored into my development, because I had to create four rectangle meshes, I had to create three cone meshes, I had to create ten box meshes for the bricks, and I had to do some trial and error until I finally got it.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
My approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones that led me to the project's completion, because one milestone build onto of the other milestone until the final project was completed like in milestone one I had to 
choose an image on google to write about how I was going to replicate it by code,
then in milestone two I had to create an complex objects with two different objects and I had to get the scale, rotation, and located just right, then in milestone three I had to create the soil plane for the hedge bush garden to set on and
I had to add WSAD keys to the camera for left, right, forward, and backward, and I had to add the QE keys to look up and down, and I had to add PO keys for the perspective and orthographic views, then in milestone four I had to add the 
textured images of plants_hedge_seamless.jpg, brick.jpg, dirt.jpg, foliage.jpg, and the plants_grass_seamless.jpg to render around the objects, then in milestone five I had to create the lighting to make the scene pop, and finally I had create three rectangle
hedge bushes, and three cone bushes top complete the 3D scene for the final project. 
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer scinece can help me in reaching my goals by giving me more career opportunities, by helping me to solve complex problems, and possibly one day to become a software developer or a game developer.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations gave me new knowledge and skills that I can apply in my future educational pathway by helping me to think critically, by helping me to understand data, by helping me helping me to solve complex problems,
by helping to code better in C++, and by helping me to create a scene to help me with game and/or design courses if I got any left.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Computional graphics and visualizations give me new knowledge and skills to apply for my future professional way, because it helps me to understand data to turn it into understandable visuals, it helps me to solve problems, 
and it helped me to gain more knowledge about C++ code to create a scene to help me to possibly become a game or software developer one day.
